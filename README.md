## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains my **personal electronics-related codes** — created as part of my learning journey and experiments in **circuit design, microcontrollers, and electronic simulations**.  

The goal of this repo is to **document, test, and refine** various concepts in **electronics + programming**, while building a reusable library of small but meaningful projects.

## 🧩 What’s Inside

- 🔋 **Basic Electronic Simulations** — Ohm’s law, voltage dividers, RC circuits, etc.  
- ⚙️ **Microcontroller Logic** — Code snippets for Arduino, ESP32, or similar boards  
- 🧠 **Signal Processing / Data Visualization**  
- 💾 **Sensor Interfacing and Control Logic**  
- 📡 **Communication Modules (UART, I2C, SPI)**  
- 🧰 **Custom Utilities and Helper Functions**

*(You can modify these categories based on your actual content.)*
